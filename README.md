# Application-Scorecard---Finance-Analytics
Application Scorecards are tools that allow organisations to predict the probability that an applicant will behave in a particular way, helping banks to make effective automated decisions. 
The most commonly used application scorecard for credit, predicts the risk of a customer paying or not.
In the case of a credit risk application scorecard the output is usually a numeric score provided for each applicant, with higher scores corresponding to lower levels of estimated risk.
